# Pull Modules

This directory will host pull-focused helpers extracted from `lib/restore.sh` and `lib/restore/`.

## Migration Notes
- Import routines move here during Phase 4.
- Utilities shared with push flows should stay in `lib/utils/`.
- Ensure pull scripts provide clear logging and remediation guidance.
